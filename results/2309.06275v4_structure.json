      "summary": "The provided document introduces **RE2 (Re-Reading)**, a simple yet effective prompting method designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The main points covered include:\n\n*   **Input-Focused Strategy:** Unlike standard thought-eliciting methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) that focus on the output phase, RE2 focuses on the input by processing the question twice (\"Read the question again\").\n*   **Bidirectional Understanding:** RE2 addresses the limitation of unidirectional attention in decoder-only LLMs. By re-reading, the second pass allows tokens to attend to subsequent information from the first pass, simulating a \"bidirectional\" encoding and improving comprehension.\n*   **Generality and Compatibility:** The method is compatible with various existing prompting techniques (e.g., CoT, PAL) and effective across different model types (e.g., LLaMA, ChatGPT) and task settings (zero-shot, few-shot).\n*   **Performance:** Extensive experiments on 14 datasets covering arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning demonstrate that RE2 consistently improves reasoning performance."

          "summary": "The partial document introduces **RE2 (Re-Reading)**, a prompting strategy designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by repeating the input question. The authors identify a limitation in decoder-only LLMs (e.g., GPT-3, LLaMA) where unidirectional attention prevents tokens from accessing future context, hindering a complete understanding of the question. Motivated by human reading comprehension strategies, the authors propose that re-reading allows the model to achieve a \"bidirectional\" understanding of the input and allocate more computational resources to encoding. The text highlights that RE2 is orthogonal to output-focused methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and demonstrates general effectiveness across various models (e.g., ChatGPT, LLaMA-2) and reasoning tasks (arithmetic, commonsense, symbolic). Finally, the document begins to outline the methodology by formally defining the Vanilla Chain-of-Thought reasoning process."

          "summary": "The provided text introduces **RE2 (Re-Reading)**, a prompting strategy designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by simply repeating the input question. The document addresses the limitation of **unidirectional attention** in decoder-only LLMs (such as GPT-3 and LLaMA), which prevents tokens from understanding subsequent context during encoding.\n\nKey points include:\n*   **The Problem:** Standard LLMs cannot achieve \"bidirectional\" understanding because they process tokens left-to-right, meaning earlier tokens cannot see later, potentially crucial keywords.\n*   **The Solution:** Inspired by human reading comprehension strategies, RE2 requires the model to process the question twice. Attention heatmaps (specifically on LLaMA-2) suggest this allows the second pass to utilize context from the first pass, effectively simulating bidirectional understanding.\n*   **Advantages:** RE2 is simple, mirrors human cognition, allocates more computational resources to input encoding, and is orthogonal to output-focused methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT).\n*   **Validation:** The text reports on extensive experiments across 14 datasets involving arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning. Results indicate that RE2 consistently improves performance across various model architectures (e.g., ChatGPT, LLaMA-2) and settings (zero-shot, few-shot).\n*   **Methodology:** The text concludes by beginning to formalize the mathematical formulation of the vanilla Chain-of-Thought reasoning process."

RE2 mimics human re-reading behavior to provide a \"bidirectional\" understanding of the question.\n*   **Methodology:** The strategy involves a simple prompt modification where the question is stated, followed by an instruction to \"Read the question again,\" and then the question is repeated. This acts as a \"plug & play\" module compatible with various models and thought-eliciting methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT).\n*   **Advantages:** RE2 allows models to allocate more computational resources to input encoding and emphasizes understanding before generation.\n*   **Experimental Validation:** The document outlines extensive experiments across 14 datasets covering arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning.
